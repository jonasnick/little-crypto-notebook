\section{Notation}
We denote the set of \emph{polynomially-bounded} functions in the security parameter $\secpar$ by $\poly = \{ f : \exists a \in \NN,\ f(\secpar) \in O(\lambda^a) \}$, the set of \emph{negligible} functions in the security parameter $\secpar$ by $\negl = \{ f : f(\secpar)^{-1} \not\in \poly \}$.

A probabilistic interactive Turing machine is \emph{probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT)} if its runtime is in $\poly$.

$\GG$ denotes a cyclic group of order $p$, where $p$ is a $\lambda$-bit prime.
We use additive notation for the group operation of $\GG$.
